P.S.
I completed the task successfully, but instead of using PyCharm, I worked on the problem using a website called Reeborg’s World. This platform provides an interactive environment for solving programming challenges,
but it doesn't generate standalone code that can be uploaded to GitHub.

As a result, while I have a working solution in Reeborg’s World, I cannot provide a directly executable script here. If you'd like to see the solution, I can either share a summary of my approach or guide you through
replicating it on Reeborg's World.
The name of the challenge: Reeborg's World Maze Challenge
